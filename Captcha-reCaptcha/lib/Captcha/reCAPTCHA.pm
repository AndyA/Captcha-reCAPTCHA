=head1 NAME

Captcha::reCAPTCHA - A Perl implementation of the reCAPTCHA API

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Captcha::reCAPTCHA version 0.95

=head1 NOTICE

Please note this module has now been switched to using v2 which is the
new version "I'm not a robot". If you still want to use the old version
you can use 'get_html_v1' and 'check_answer_v1' although this is not recommended.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Note this release contains methods that use

    use Captcha::reCAPTCHA;

    my $c = Captcha::reCAPTCHA->new;

    # Output form
    print $c->get_html( 'your public key here' );

    # To use the old version use (not recommended)
    print $c->get_html_v1( 'your public key here' );

    # Verify submission
    my $result = $c->check_answer( $privatekey, $remoteip, $response);

    # Verify submission for old version
    my $result = $c->check_answer_v1(
        'your private key here', $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'},
        $challenge, $response
    );

    if ( $result->{is_valid} ) {
        print "Yes!";
    }
    else {
        # Error
        $error = $result->{error};
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

reCAPTCHA is a hybrid mechanical turk and captcha that allows visitors
who complete the captcha to assist in the digitization of books.

From L<http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html>:

    reCAPTCHA improves the process of digitizing books by sending words that
    cannot be read by computers to the Web in the form of CAPTCHAs for
    humans to decipher. More specifically, each word that cannot be read
    correctly by OCR is placed on an image and used as a CAPTCHA. This is
    possible because most OCR programs alert you when a word cannot be read
    correctly.

This version 1 Perl implementation is modelled on the PHP interface that can be
found here:

L<http://recaptcha.net/plugins/php/>

To use reCAPTCHA you need to register your site here:

L<https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create>


=head1 INTERFACE

=item C<< new >>

Create a new C<< Captcha::reCAPTCHA >>.

=cut

sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my $self = bless {}, $class;

  croak "new must be called with a reference to a hash of parameters"
   unless 'HASH' eq ref $args;
}

sub _html { shift->{_html} ||= HTML::Tiny->new }

=item C<< get_options_setter( $options ) >>

You can optionally customize the look of the reCAPTCHA widget with some
JavaScript settings. C<get_options_setter> returns a block of Javascript
wrapped in <script> .. </script> tags that will set the options to be used
by the widget.

C<$options> is a reference to a hash that may contain the following keys:

=over

=item C<theme>

Defines which theme to use for reCAPTCHA. Possible values are 'red',
'white' or 'blackglass'. The default is 'red'.

=item C<tabindex>

Sets a tabindex for the reCAPTCHA text box. If other elements in the
form use a tabindex, this should be set so that navigation is easier for
the user. Default: 0.

=back

=cut

     . ";\n//]]>\n"
  ) . "\n";
}

=item C<< get_options_setter_div( $pubkey, $options ) >>

You can optionally customize the look of the reCAPTCHA widget with some
settings. C<get_options_setter_div> returns a div element
wrapped in <div> .. </div> tags that will set the options to be used
by the widget.

C<$options> is a reference to a hash that may contain the following keys:

=over

=item C<data-theme>

Defines which theme to use for reCAPTCHA. Possible values are 'dark',
'light'. The default is 'light'.

=item C<data-type>

Defines the type of captcha to server. Possible values are 'audio' or 'image'.
Default is 'image'

=item C<data-size>

Defines the size of the widget. Possible values are 'compact' or 'normal'.
Default is 'normal'

=item C<data-tabindex>

Defines the tabindex of the widget and challenge. If other elements in your
page use tabindex, it should be set to make user navigation easier.
Default is 0

=item C<data-callback>

Defines the name of your callback function to be executed when the user submits
a successful CAPTCHA response. The user's response, g-recaptcha-response,
will be the input for your callback function.

=item C<data-expired-callback>

Defines the name of your callback function to be executed when the recaptcha
response expires and the user needs to solve a new CAPTCHA

=back

Generates HTML to display the captcha using the new api
pubkey is public key for \%options types the same as get_options_setter

This uses ssl by default and does not display custom error messages

    print $captcha->get_html_v1( $PUB, $err );

=over

=item C<< $pubkey >>

Your reCAPTCHA public key, from the API Signup Page

=item C<< $error >>

Optional. If set this should be either a string containing a reCAPTCHA
status code or a result hash as returned by C<< check_answer_v1 >>.

=item C<< $use_ssl >>

Optional. Should the SSL-based API be used? If you are displaying a page
to the user over SSL, be sure to set this to true so an error dialog
doesn't come up in the user's browser.

=item C<< $options >>

Optional. A reference to a hash of options for the captcha. See
C<< get_options_setter >> for more details.

Returns a string containing the HTML that should be used to display
the captcha.

After the user has filled out the HTML form, including their answer for
the CAPTCHA, use C<< check_answer >> to check their answer when they
submit the form. The user's answer will be in field,
g-recaptcha-response. The reCAPTCHA
library will make an HTTP request to the reCAPTCHA server and verify the
user's answer.

The value of the form field recaptcha_response_field.

See the /examples subdirectory for examples of how to call C<check_answer>.

Note: this method will make an HTTP request to Google to verify the user input.
If this request must be routed via a proxy in your environment, use the
standard environment variable to specify the proxy address, e.g.:

    $ENV{http_proxy} = 'http://myproxy:3128';

recaptcha_challenge_field and recaptcha_response_field. The reCAPTCHA
library will make an HTTP request to the reCAPTCHA server and verify the
user's answer.
