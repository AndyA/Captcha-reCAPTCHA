=head1 NAME

Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide - A Perl implementation of the reCAPTCHA Mailhide API

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide version 0.93

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide;
    
    my $m = Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide->new;

    # Get the URL that reveals the email
    my $url = $m->mailhide_url( MAIL_PUBLIC_KEY, MAIL_PRIVATE_KEY, 'someone@example.com' );

    # Or - even easier - get the formatted HTML for an email link
    print $m->mailhide_html( MAIL_PUBLIC_KEY, MAIL_PRIVATE_KEY, 'someone@example.com' );

For complete examples see the /examples subdirectory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

reCAPTCHA is a hybrid mechanical turk and captcha that allows visitors
who complete the captcha to assist in the digitization of books.

From L<http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html>:

    reCAPTCHA improves the process of digitizing books by sending words that
    cannot be read by computers to the Web in the form of CAPTCHAs for
    humans to decipher. More specifically, each word that cannot be read
    correctly by OCR is placed on an image and used as a CAPTCHA. This is
    possible because most OCR programs alert you when a word cannot be read
    correctly.

This Perl implementation is modelled on the PHP interface that can be
found here:

L<http://recaptcha.net/plugins/php/>

=head1 INTERFACE

To use reCAPTCHA Mailhide you need to get a public, private key pair
from this page:

L<http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/apikey>

The Mailhide API consists of two methods C<< mailhide_html >>
and C<< mailhide_url >>. The methods have the same parameters.

The _html version returns HTML that can be directly put on your web
page. The username portion of the email that is passed in is
truncated and replaced with a link that calls Mailhide. The _url
version gives you the url to decode the email and leaves it up to you
to place the email in HTML.

=over

=item C<< new >>

Create a new C<< Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide >>.

=item C<< mailhide_url( $pubkey, $privkey, $email ) >>

Generate a link that will decode the specified email address.

=over

=item C<< $pubkey >>

The Mailhide public key from the signup page

=item C<< $privkey >>

The Mailhide private key from the signup page

=item C<< $email >>

The email address you want to hide.

=back

Returns a URL that when clicked will allow the user to decode the hidden
email address.

=item C<< mailhide_html( $pubkey, $privkey, $email ) >>

Generates HTML markup to embed a Mailhide protected email address
on a page.

The arguments are the same as for C<mailhide_url>.

Returns a string containing HTML that may be embedded directly in
a web page.

=back
