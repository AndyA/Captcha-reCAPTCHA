0.9     2007-11-01
        Code unchanged. Version bump because I packaged the last version
        with Leopard's tar - which likes to add Apple specific extended
        attrs. Grrr.

        Ditched use of version.pm. Sick of version number confusion.

0.92    2007-11-19
        Split Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide into a separate distro so we
        don't have to depend on Crypt::Rijndael.
